## 1. ABOUT ##
- - - -
Most multiplexed immunofluorescence workflows involve segmenting individual cells from tissue samples. A nuclear marker, such as DAPI, is usually used to segment individual nuclei. The accuracy achievable by segmentation platforms is a persistent bottleneck that is preventing the advancement of the field. To make matters worse, different segmentation platforms perform with varying levels of success on different datasets due to a multitude of factors (cell morphology, illumination differences between microscopes, diffused staining etc.). There is a need for an evaluation scheme to compare nuclear segmentation performance of various platforms for a particular dataset so as to chose one to proceed with.

This repository aims at providing a means for standardized implementation, as well as qualitative and quantitative evaluation of various nuclear segmentation platforms. The code can be tweaked to customize for other platforms being evaluated.
